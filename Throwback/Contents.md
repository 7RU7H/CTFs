#### Introduction
#### Introductory to AD and PowerShell Section
**Task 5 AD Basics (Reading): **  

For this I provide my activeDirectoryDefined.md as collection everything learnt thus far in its current state.

**Task 6 Letâ€™s Get Offensive (Reading) **

For this I provide a Powershell101.md, but I suggest:  
[x in y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/powershell/)  
I a good references for starting and returning too, but there are a few other resources that really help with the nitty-gritty of powershell:  
[Microsoft Scripting Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/)  

Also I will provide my current very very limit ADPrivEsc CheatSheet and some useful Powershell stuff in its current state, but please check out my [Archive repository](https://github.com/7RU7H/Archive)  
It also contains both regular Linux and Windows PrivEsc cheetsheats also! 

**Task 7 Entering the Breach**

This section was more of a directional spring board to then try new things, please see the TryThisStuff section to see a list of tools, techniques, etc tried. 

**Task 8 Exploring the Caverns**

Finally figured out how to use those nice screenshots I see on writeups and walk through that seem be nicely cropped. I also use nikto and nuclei awesome tools that I am using in my bug bounty tool I am making called the [H4dd1xB4gd3r](https://github.com/7RU7H/H4dd1xB4dg3r). Tried and failed to reconftw to run, will try again at later enuemration stage.
