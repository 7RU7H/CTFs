For this I provide my activeDirectoryDefined.md as collection everything learnt thus far in its current state.

[x in y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/powershell/)

[Microsoft Scripting Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/)  

Also I will provide my current very very limit ADPrivEsc CheatSheet and some useful Powershell stuff in its current state, but please check out my [Archive repository](https://github.com/7RU7H/Archive)
