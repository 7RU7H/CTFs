# Conclusion


In review, ...



Sadly I can not recommend this to those without some kind of personal local setup. I attempted this without using only using THM AttackBox and Kali VM. I am far from an expert, but would it not make sense for the Kali VM to be almost-rolling Kali, with tool from the Paid Rooms. Once I got to Task 22 the piling up of troubleshooting was too much. I do not think I have the time to continue trying to make that work - I used the time waiting to do other things so I did not lose out where other might have. 

For example Crackmapexec is part of rolling Kali, I am biased to the python3 just keep it as-up-to-date-as-possible-line-of-think, why not be default have pip3, why have msfconsole < 6? Questions that arise wasted the most time of the entiry. If I wasn't doing this to review this and my own setup for tools I would need for OSPC and my own Kali setup then someone else would have probably upended a table and thrown everything out of a window. If you can't afford or know how to setup and maintain a personal box then avoid this room. For any propective customers, avoid the VMs and make your own. General support is great from THM and the community but the using their VMs for this room is a nightmare.
