# Exploring the Caverns Part Three 

Part three now, but I feeling the momentuum of progression. Plan of attack before attempting to even look to answering questions on the Task 8 Drop-Down is as follows:

CVE-2018-15473 to get as many credientals as possible before SMB enumeration with Enum4linuxand smbmap, exfiltrating share data and credientals. If possible try to get foothold and maintain persistance with couple backdoors(just try to emulate what I atleast read about and tried in various THM rooms).

[CVE-2018-15473](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-15473_) states:  
*"OpenSSH through 7.7 is prone to a user enumeration vulnerability due to not delaying bailout for an invalid authenticating user until after the packet containing the request has been fully parsed, related to auth2-gss.c, auth2-hostbased.c, and auth2-pubkey.c."*

[exploit](https://github.com/Rhynorater/CVE-2018-15473-Exploit)
```bash
python3 sshUsernameEnumExploit.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "sshUsernameEnumExploit.py", line 33, in <module>
    old_parse_service_accept = paramiko.auth_handler.AuthHandler._handler_table[paramiko.common.MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT]
TypeError: 'property' object is not subscriptable

```
[issue:1](https://github.com/Rhynorater/CVE-2018-15473-Exploit/issues)

Find and replace all instances on \_handler_table with:
```bash
vim sshUsernameEnumExploit.py
:%s/_handler_table/_client_handler_table/gc
# Press a!
```
We then get:
```bash
python3 sshUsernameEnumExploit.py 
usage: sshUsernameEnumExploit.py [-h] [--port PORT] [--threads THREADS]
                                 [--outputFile OUTPUTFILE]

                                 (--username USERNAME | --userList USERLIST)
                                 hostname
sshUsernameEnumExploit.py: error: the following arguments are required: hostname
```
Find wordlists for usernames
```bash

```

While this a very meta-room note: after using nuclei on many other THM boxes it seems like this a somewhat unintended path. To get username enumeration, but seeing as I has yet to use this exploit and for the better of script modification and OSCP. I'll give this attempt futher credence at slightly later point, after manual website enumeration.

On the contacts tab all the local email addresses are avaliable for a guest user to email. This would present a flaw in the attempt to maintain high stardards of confidentality. This mailing list is goldmine for APT groups and cyber-criminals without phishing. The CEO, CFO,  CTO internal email addresses are exposed.

## Finally
I realised that this experience was still quite fenced in given the amount of clickables and user input. And seeing as I have yet to complete the Phishing rooms and that one the advertised parts of this is phishing. Before moving forward I tried:
xxs polyglot:
```js
jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */onerror=alert('THM') )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert('THM')//>\x3e
```

I broke the burp suite browser trying this so had to restart. Maybe something to return too.
