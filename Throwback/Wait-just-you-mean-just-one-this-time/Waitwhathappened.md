# Note of facepalm-ery
At this point I must confess and remember the failing and errors that occured during the completion of this section. I am very new to github and I have really only learnt about much this in the last week. Due to this lack of experience and me being ill I think this can be excused, but not anything that would allude to informational corruption or deceit. To me a lie no matter how small is cancerious thing and we grow as human no matter who deceptive or cunning to be beholden to the truth. 

*Even the greatest spymaster or weaver of lies cannot escape truth, it is always the weapon at the back of one's head, forget this is at your peril*

We may not as species have found an algorithm for the Truth, unfortunately it probably only a matter of time. Enough philosophy, knowledge, the condensing and sharing of it more important:

I learnt of technology and myself:
1. git merging, 
1. git asynchronised commits, pull and pushes
1. use git with cli only don't mix and match
3. Mentalist wordlist making - save your chains! 
4. READ WHAT YOU MADE BEFORE YOU MAKE A LIST, don't waste precision disk memory
5. Thinking fast and slow by Kahneman will go by my toilet next  [free pdf](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxleXAyMDE0dWRlc2F8Z3g6MzQ5MDc1ZmFmMGZhM2Q1)
6. While ill trying to do something even simpler than bruteforcing a website.
7. Ferengi rule of acquisition `109.Â  Dignity and an empty sack is worth the sack`
8. Meta-cognition is not something you really do while being really ill
