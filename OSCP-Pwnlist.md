1. HTB -> OSProving Grounds -> Randomizer Practice Exam (THM, HTB, OSPG) - need make a auto-extend THM machine script
2. Walkthrough a non TJNull or Active HTB
3. THM AD boxes or OP path

## HTB
#### HTB Walkthroughs
These are machines that I used alongside OSCP.pdf and Ippsec videos while making cheatsheet, figuring out where my weak spots were. These a 5-6 hour long sessions of just pausing a video - trying stuff, reading stuff adding to Archive.

Plan being to get more experience without insane timesinks of failing hard and maximise revision and metacognitive linking. Then in three months redo these machines as Writeups to challenge myself.
