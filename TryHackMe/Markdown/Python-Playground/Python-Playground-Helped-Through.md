Need to some THM, but I also need to figure out a best in slot FTP server for CTFs (build and tear down) and one that is a most secure for just in case and for one of the Beyond Root challenges for [[Kotarak-Helped-Through]]. I decided that I have not done a Alh4zr3d stream in a week so I also need to improve my Python so I chose [Cthulhu Cthursday: TryHackMe's "GameBuzz" and "Python Playground"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqNKLu_y6H8). I also need to do some execise in the intervals. This Helped-Through is paired with [[GameBuzz-Helped-Through]]. 

Apparently these are malders. I here to learn to boulder the malders one day.
