Digital communication via Chats and DMs is not a strength of mine. I am people person with good SE, where most of the modern world post covid spent their days on Zoom and Discord, I was on the front lines talking to people. I know I have some catching up to do in that respect. These channels of communication will not go away. [Cthulhu Cthursday: TryHackMe's "RacetrackBank"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF2HJq4kaVE) will be a practice and further research os Online Social Skill 101 ++;  I made an arse of myself twice - being incorrect in the hope of helping, decided not pollute the evening or anyone elses and consider how to actually communicate over chat. My conclusions being that it is just of context - set and setting issue tied to wanting to be social in with other that like this stuff while I never have used chat on phones or discord, twitch, twitter, facebook. Email is just glorifed letters that make people waste their time deleting them. Decided I did not want this inital failure to be damaging as it copuld have been during turning almost user on [[Support-Helped-Through]] will is imperative practice being chat without being in chat and research how to connect my provably excellent social skills in-person to online.
