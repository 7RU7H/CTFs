#### Mindmap-per Service

- OS detect, run generate noting for nmap
- 80 http
	- id parameter is get the page
	- SQL is being queried for the number of packages
	- Filtering 
		- blacklisting  `' -- # %23 @`
		- usable ` | ! , . ()` 
		- breaks:  \` 

- At this point I just went from `ls -1tr Screenshots` and figured it out be screenshot what was going on - going naming convention for Screenshots helped as they do

Key takeaways
- Always play guess the SQL query
	- Union statements of the legitimate query must be mirrored in our SQL injection
- Start smaller 
-
