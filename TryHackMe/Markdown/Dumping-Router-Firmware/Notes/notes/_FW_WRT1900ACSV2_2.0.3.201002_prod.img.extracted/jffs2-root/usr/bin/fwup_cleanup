# When the firmware updater uses the flash to store the firmware, it
# creates a lot of work for JFFS2 to do to clean up (after writing and
# deleting a relatively large file). There were cases where on slower systems,
# after a reboot, the JFFS2 garbage collector would be busy, and somehow
# causes syscfg.dat to have zero length for several seconds, resulting in 
# syscfg.dat being regenerated as if from a factory reset. The exact
# mechanism is unknown, however, if we give JFFS2 time to clean up after
# firmware update, this problem seems to go away.
#
# To help JFFS2 properly clean up, we force a sync, then send
# SIGHUP to the JFFS2 garbage collector to trigger it, then we wait the
# configured wait time.
# Note currently there is only one writeable partition using JFFS2,
# so this code only triggers the first and only garbage collector.
