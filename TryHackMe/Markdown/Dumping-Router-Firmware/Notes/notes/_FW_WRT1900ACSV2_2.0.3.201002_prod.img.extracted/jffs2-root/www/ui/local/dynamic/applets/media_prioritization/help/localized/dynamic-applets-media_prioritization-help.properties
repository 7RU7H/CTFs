129d97ea=High Priority - is for devices and applications that need bandwidth priority to keep them running smoothly, for example, devices that stream movies or music. You move devices from the Normal Priority list to here if you want to give them a higher priority.
13b45e48=To add a new application or game, click the dropdown arrow for Applications or Games and select <em>Add a new application</em> or <em>Add a new game</em>.
311601fb=Set Media Prioritization
3394f785=Media Prioritization
3f5c368b=Device Prioritization
4d306d39=<em>No acknowledgement</em> - Specify whether the router re-sends data if an error occurs.
558d44e3=Reset Prioritization
5942c48b=You can edit the settings for a game or application that you added, or delete it from the list entirely. You can&#39;t edit or delete a game or application that you didn&#39;t add.
5bf953fc=To prioritize devices, under <em>Apps</em>, choose <em>Media Prioritization</em>, then select <em>On</em> to enable this feature.
5eb0fdf0=Add a New Application or Game
6c9b344e=<em>Note:</em> If you set the downstream bandwidth too high, the router can&#39;t apply priorities correctly and problems may occur.
6fd65fac=Back to Top
71490436=Use this to reset the Media Prioritization settings to the default values. Doing this clears any prioritization settings you&#39;ve made and the default settings will be used. After the reset, you can make changes to the default settings.
71d6b8d0=Select the device, application, or game you want to give priority to and move it to the <em>High Priority</em> list at the top of the page. You can give three items high priority. You can also move devices down to the Normal Priority list if they no longer need bandwidth priority.
77fda8df=Change Media Prioritization Settings
896660df=Media Prioritization lets you decide which devices or applications get network bandwidth priority. For example, if you have a smart TV or a computer that you often stream movies with, you can move that device to the top of the priority list so that it gets the bandwidth it needs to keep movies running smoothly without interruption. It won&#39;t have to compete with other devices on your network for bandwidth.
8db272fd=The Media Prioritization page has two levels of priority:
8eca6c26=<em>Downstream bandwidth</em> - Specify the downstream bandwidth speed to use, in kilobits per second (kbps).
8f6a521d=Enter the port range and the protocol that the application or game uses in the <em>Port range</em> fields.
985d6dbd=Edit or Delete a Game or Application
98a23114=Click Settings to turn on/off WMM Support and No Acknowledgement. Wi-Fi Multimedia Support improves quality of audio, video and voice applications. It is on by default. No Acknowledgement, when on, tells Velop to resend data to devices when errors occur. It is off by default.
9a2d19f5=Device prioritization uses the results of a speed check to determine the amount of your internet capacity to direct to high priority devices. If you feel the results of the Velop speed check are inaccurate, you can input speeds manually. It is important that the numbers are accurate to get the most out of this feature. We recommend you go to <a href="http://speedtest.net" target="_blank">http://speedtest.net</a> on your laptop, or contact your ISP to find your actual speed and then enter it manually.
9ef15554=Normal Priority - is for the devices and applications that do not need special bandwidth consideration.
a369eae7=The devices currently connected to your network that have Normal Priority are listed in the <em>Devices</em> box. The <em>Applications</em> and <em>Games</em> dropdowns show common applications and games; you may or may not currently use these on your computers and devices.
b9fa0606=Click <em>Ok</em> when finished.
c9d76a75=To edit the information for an application or game, select the game or application from the dropdown list, and then click the <em>Edit</em> link. To delete the game or application, click the <em>Delete</em> link.
df316231=To set additional media prioritization settings, click <em>Settings</em>. The following options are available:
e0759790=Device prioritization allows you to choose devices for priority usage of your internet connection. High priority devices – wired and/or wireless – always will have the best access when connected. Normal priority devices share the leftover capacity. Drag and drop devices to change priority. We recommend high priority for devices used to stream video or play online games, and other demanding applications.
e9c23d80=If editing, make the changes to the name, port, or protocol information for the application or game.
eeb6580a=<em>WMM Support</em> - Turn Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) support On or Off. This is turned On by default and improves quality for audio, video, and voice applications by prioritizing wireless traffic. To use this feature, the wireless client devices on your network must support WMM.
f524399f=Enter the name of the application or game.
