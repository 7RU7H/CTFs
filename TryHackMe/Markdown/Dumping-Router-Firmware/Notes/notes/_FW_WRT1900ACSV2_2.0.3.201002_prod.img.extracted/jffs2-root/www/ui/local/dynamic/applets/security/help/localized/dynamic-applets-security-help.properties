0c6248a7=Your router includes a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) feature that forwards all inbound ports presented on the WAN interface, except those that are specifically forwarded, to an IP address or MAC address. This feature can be used to expose a web server, mail server, or web camera to the Internet so anyone can access it. This feature is not typically used as it presents significant security risks to the device that you designate for the DMZ. The device is not protected by the built-in firewalls, Internet filters, or router web filters.
17d59472=Port range triggering allows the router to watch outgoing data for specific port numbers. The IP address of the computer that sends the matching data is remembered by the router, so that when the requested data returns through the router, the data is routed back to the proper computer. This is useful when using a USB or Bluetooth headset for online chat and gaming. Click <em>Add a new Port Range Triggering</em>.
