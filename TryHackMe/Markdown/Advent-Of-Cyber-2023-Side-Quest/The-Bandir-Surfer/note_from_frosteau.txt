Dear McSkidy:

I have a high suspicion that The Bandit Yeti is looking for a way to infiltrate The Best Festival Company once again. I have questions regarding this server:
1. Why are we using the database to download images? Can't we just download them directly from the site? Otherwise, please make sure the queries are properly sanitized.
2. You don't need root privileges to run the website checker script. I believe you mentioned that this was supposed to be taken care of, but it looks like it hasn't been done yet.

Sincerely,
Detective Frost-eau
