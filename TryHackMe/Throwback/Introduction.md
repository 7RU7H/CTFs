# Introduction
This my introductory statement regarding my documentation of completing Throwback from the ethical hacking website and training platform: [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/).  

I write this document with the intent to gather knowledge and improve skills. This includes my report writing in slightly less *formal* stylistically, which will allow for more freedoms to practice writing generally about cybersecurity and have a more relaxed tone. This document will hold alot of my trials and errors, minor and major milestones of success and maybe some humour.  

I have learnt a vast amount from a great many others and I think that if my journey is to be worth something more and to the community I hope this document will be a small part of my giving back in kind. Along with this piece I will use Throwback revise and improve my work be it add to tools, scripts and cheatsheets to my github to provide a condensing of my knowledge and experiences. 

## Whoami

 I am from a low-level C and deep/machine learning outersider-hobbist background, almost entirely self-taught thinking I had missed the proverbial boat with the networking and hacking side of things. Recommended and found tryhackme. I mostly have used Tryhackme as learning platform. And now 271 day streak on tryhackme. I learnt all my basic and advanced web, network, windows, linux concepts and hacking from tryhackme. I have yet to use HTB, Pentester labs and OFSEC proving ground, but plan to in  2022. I doing Throwback to level up my methodology, understanding and writen knowledge-base about Active Directory, C2 Frameworks, Proxies and Pivoting,Window networking and machine hacking. I currently doing the One Learn for OSCP which I hope to take the examine in late October. I am also going to take Network+ late June.

## My Plan and Goals

Throwback will mostly be more realistic experience to help with my OSCP than most of the walkthrough boxes on Tryhackme. It is also a network of boxes, something that will be novel to me when I start. Black Box vs. White Box?  This will be probably be an entirely a whitebox run. I am documenting experiences and building my obsidean vaults. On the 29th of March 2022 at 13:00 GMT I am rank 384 Globally and in the UK rank 33, and the UK ranking other than the top four are changing alot and I have steadily continued to rise. 

I will hold myself to attempting to blackbox every task for an hour, just to push myself and never rest in a mindset that is comfortable. This document will contain mistakes and failed attempts. It will not be a quick sheet of answers, but I hope it answers whether Throwback is worth it. Although that might be forgone conclusion to myself, I hope that this document provides some fresh insights to those that are unsure.

These 30 days of access will also part of major overhaul of my notetaking. Both making .txt more .md and also refining the knowledge in each. I am bit of collector, but refining a collection I use and hope will help others. Also I using this lab as an opportunity to force me to use Cherry Tree and improve the overall quality of my repositories of information.

I am familiar with Powershell, but must improve. This room will help with potential oppunities to both use Powershell to solve problems and I hope that it provide inspiration for scripts and maybe plans to more outlandish code using Powershell.

I currently building my own recon scripts for singlar targets with [nvmRecon](https://github.com/7RU7H/method/tree/main/nvmRecon) and a bug bounty recon automation suite called [theH4dd1xB4dg3r](https://github.com/7RU7H/method/tree/main/theH4dd1xB4dg3r). I know that there are new tools to try, scripting to clickety-clack-out, methodolgy to improve; I am going to use Throwback as that test ground. This lab is perfect in ensure that legal scoping issues and that network is small enough not to waste time with broken testing.
