# Just a Drop Will Do 

This task is very easy and although it was a very watered down version of something that I will try again on the Vuln-Active Room. I had failed to troubleshoot responder the last time, but I highly recommend doing that room. I requires use a redis database to then performed a LLMNR request for you to then get the hash of  the database user to gain a main foothold on Active Directory machine. I switched to the AttackBox from the Kali VM on THM and worked absolutely fine.
