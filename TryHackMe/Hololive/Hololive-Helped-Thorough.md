- `deepce` is `linpeas` for docker containers
- Chisel
- Golang compilation nitty gritty
- More Situational Awareness or may the trench that is Dunning Kroger
- Walk the the Webserver directory on at a time before/after/due second reverse shell
Beyond Root

- AV Evasion a historic set of techniques additions:
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJGROL0PM4I&pp=ygUNYWxoNHpyM2QgaG9sbw%3D%3D
- Homage to Aquinas https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/ctf-writeups/blob/master/tryhackme-rooms/hololive.md + copying the writing style for another machine.

Returning to this after lots of Hack the Box I decided to follow along with [Alh4zr3d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqnnKMU3XMk) purely to fit with my work schedule that include another six hours plus after this. I need mentorship and I need practical experience that is less-head-smashing-problem-solving-stress to pace out the the marathon of learning everything for the exam I need. Some humour and Cthulhu mythos is great addition to my day. It was very enjoyable to do this this way. I learnt a lot and loads of fun.

#### Authorial Opinions - Skip Ahead 

Weebs, prepare the Flashgitz videos..actually [Filthy Frank WEEABOOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFQQALduhzA&pp=ygUUd2VlYnMgYXJlIGV2ZXJ5d2hlcmU%3D) video I watched a long time ago made me realise that I could be considered a competent in the culture I was born into, and culture appreciation and mixing is very important for the growth of human. Powerful groups still want for an identity and there are some aspects of all cultures are taboo, abhorrent or social faux-par. An obsession with drawing and proliferation school girls is glorifying the reduced left frontal cortex and the domination of the not fully grown, conscious and capable (etc). Therefore glorifying decadence of the Nietzsche idea - non-thoughtful non-empathetic and non-human aspects of the self, group or human system. There is probably a real horrific historic reason it exists, but to understand that probably is derived from trauma of persons, groups it was what help is about. They need to realise and better themselves by recognition of what deterministic universe has force them now to accept, why not choose an identity not dominated by the past trauma and on the non-decadent choices of the most conscious choices to be made by the self or group.

If its just harmless school girl and there cute and you are a women, predators fetishise their prey to enjoy the pursuit - hormones and chemicals - and like a viruses or antibodies will seek to spread and propagate their world view. If you are some coloured flag person with pronouns, why not actualise the representation of who you can or want to be rather than than iconography, which you can't -  you are not 2D, stopping being insecure.

I wondered what was going on, I cant get execution but AV is actually removing it. As much as I have enjoyed the stream I will return to this probably in two days time after I have read everything in the next couple of sections as there is some divergence of path.

## 2024 Return to complete

Found this nice database dumping script, has to run as root
```bash

Apparent Rock, now ASHAMED_BARBITURATE for more amazing Sliver names.. [Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate Truth serum is bullshit generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate). *The memory-impairing effects and cognitive impairments induced by sodium thiopental are thought to reduce a subject's ability to invent and remember lies. This practice is no longer considered legally admissible in court, owing to findings that subjects undergoing such interrogations may form false memories, putting the reliability of all information obtained through such methods into question.* It was a simpler time with simpler minds still apparently... Any way the truth is something you have to work for like anything else there is trying hard and smartly trying. Looking forward to the next Windows beacon name. I do not think you I can get this level of fun information through Video Games as good a Baldur Gate 3 absolutely is.. someone will probably make an amazing mod for it like a expansion like how DOS2 tried to get people to DM the Game not sure whether it worked. Old day when I am on a Ring World maybe I will get to have friends and family and play games like that together when I have time - I forgot what barbiturates were. Waiting for cronjobs and compilations and Al to get to the point I am/was at. Anyway knowing how these all situations go. Issues ahoy I know why they go the way they go.


Not persistence.. nice `bash`
![](notpersistence.png)
Eventually, sloppiness in my secondary shell, which thankfully is run in memory by sliver... but packet economy is packet economy. And my `nohup` does not seem to work on this, but its all part of the situation today at least I learnt to read and learn from the history of this.

I am pretty sure that I need I need to have a pivot through LServ1 for my OneDrive -> Cmd.exe looking forward to the awesome name.  

Pivots != `Portfwd`, egress through implants; [Pivoting](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Pivots) - C2 Traffic

// For implant that will be the pivot listener  
use $session-id
// Open a pivot port

// get details on a specific pivot listener; graph will display the json with more infowhether it worked. Old day when I am on a Ring World maybe I will get to have friends and famil
pivots detail | pivot graph
// Generate a Pivot Implant  that will connect to the pivot listener 
generate --tcp-pivot 10.10.10.10:6969
```

Some people get there kicks from power, but for me I exist to slowly and methodically fix and try and try and try, like drowning for dopamine. [Like the monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIxYCDbRGJc), except all the hurdles in my life will vanish in time crystallised into moments like this [hilarious douche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr7bf6tIzWs).

// By default all port forwards will be bound to the `127.0.0.1` interface, but you can override this using the `--bind` flag
// Local port forward

// Reverse Port forward
rportfwd add --remote 10.10.10.10:22

#### AV Evasion Notes for the Archive

The Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) is a PowerShell security feature that will allow any applications or services to integrate into antimalware products to scan payloads before execution inside of the runtime. For documentation: [Windows docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/). AMSI is instrumented in both `System.Management.Automation.dll` and within the [Common Language Runtime CLR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr)

![](amsiarchwithsrc.png)

AMSI response codes per scan: 
```cpp
AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN = 0
AMSI_RESULT_NOT_DETECTED = 1
AMSI_RESULT_BLOCKED_BY_ADMIN_START = 16384
AMSI_RESULT_BLOCKED_BY_ADMIN_END = 20479
AMSI_RESULT_DETECTED = 32768
```

AMSI is fully integrated into the following Windows components.  
- User Account Control, or UAC
- PowerShell
- Windows Script Host (wscript and cscript)
- JavaScript and VBScript
- Office VBA macros
- Third-party AMSI integration:

`Invoke-Obfuscation`,Â [https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation): *"Invoke-Obfuscation is a PowerShell v2.0+ compatible PowerShell command and script obfuscator."*
- [Co-creator Daniel Bohannon's Usage Guide from personal blog](https://www.danielbohannon.com/blog-1/2017/12/2/the-invoke-obfuscation-usage-guide). 
 
It has a tree structure to obfuscation using `\\` as a delimiter between token commands, strings, whitespace and digit to the perform Obfuscation techniques with the PowerShell source code.   
```powershell
Invoke-Obfuscation -ScriptBlock {'Payload Here'} -Command 'Token\\String\\1,2,\\Whitespace\\1' -Quiet -NoExit

#### On return

Develope, compile and execute for PowerShell shell for the personal objectives:
- https://github.com/rasta-mouse/AmsiScanBufferBypass/blob/main/AmsiBypass.cs
- Test with  [https://github.com/RythmStick/AMSITrigger](https://github.com/RythmStick/AMSITrigger), written by RythmStick (only tests against AMSI not Defender), but also requires environment replication, which takes hours and at this point that is somewhat overkill and redundant and waste of my time.
