Better Description:  
Goals: OSCP revision, demonstrate how far I have come since Throwback..
Learnt:
- Tie functionality of pages together
- deepce is linpeas for docker containers
- Chisel
- Golang compilation nitty gritty
- More Situational Awareness or may the trench that is Dunning Kroger
- Walk the the Webserver directory on at a time before/after/due second reverse shell


Returning to this after lots of Hack the Box I decided to follow along with [Alh4zr3d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqnnKMU3XMk) purely to fit with my work schedule that include another siz hours plus after this. I need mentorship and I need practical experience that is less-head-smashing-problem-solving-stress to pace out the the marathon of learning everything for the exam I need. Some humor and Cthulu mythos is great addition to my day. It was very enjoyable to do this this way. I learnt alot and loads of fun.

What domains loads images on the first web page?
```
www.holo.live
```
What are the two other domains present on the web server? Format: Alphabetical Order
```
admin.holo.live, dev.holo.live
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git
```


#### Task 10

![](localpathwp.png)

What file leaks the web server's current directory?

```
robots.txt
```

What file loads images for the development domain?

`dev.holo.live/img.php?file=images/$file.jpg`

```
img.php
```

What is the full path of the credentials file on the administrator domain?

`admin.hole.live/robots.txt`

```
/var/www/admin/supersecretdir/creds.txt
```

#### Task 11

I suggest Learning about Ansible and Packer or you could use test file inclusion 
`dev.holo.live/img.php?file=images/$file.jpg`

Downloading a Ubuntu server and going back to a ToDo list of mine in the background...

![1000](fileinclusion.png)

#### Task 12

What file is vulnerable to LFI on the development domain?
```
img.php
```
What parameter in the file is vulnerable to LFI?
```
file
```

What file found from the information leak returns an HTTP error code 403 on the administrator domain?

- I missed this because already tried then went back to use the lfi while I download a ubuntu server to try build some Vulnerable and Safe VMs machines with packer

```
/var/www/admin/supersecretdir/creds.txt
```

Using LFI on the development domain read the above file. What are the credentials found from the file?
```
admin:DBManagerLogin
```

Because the lfi you can then grab all the files! Be aware of the difference.

#### Task 22

The /etc/shadow has vandalised or broken so I could not crack it
```
linuxrulez
```

#### Task 23 - 28

```lua
Nmap scan report for 10.200.107.31

reset for gurag:

```

Set in the url to the `user_token=`  on requesting gurag password. Apparently very unrealistic reset password functionality. I have tried reset password testing on CTFs and there never has been one on all the machines I have done so far. Putting it on the CTFs lokup list

What user can we control for a password reset on S-SRV01?
```
gurag
```
What is the name of the cookie intercepted on S-SRV01?
```
user_token
```
What is the size of the cookie intercepted on S-SRV01?
```
110
```
What page does the reset redirect you to when successfully authenticated on S-SRV01?
```
reset.php
```

#### Task 29

Thankfully Al uses Empire for the stream so my OSCP preparation continue to press on in a fun manner. 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-debian
https://bc-security.gitbook.io/empire-wiki/quickstart/installation
Remember to consider the use of telemetry that comes with .NET by opting out with environment variables. 

gurag : password

linux-admin linuxrulez

![](images.png)

I wondered what was going on, I cant get execution but AV is actually removing it. As much as I have enjoyed the stream I will return to this probably in two days time after I have read everything in the next couple of sections as there is some divergence of path.
