Jill,

I think the helmet key is inside the text file, but I have no clue on decrypting stuff. Also, I come across a /hidden_closet/ door but it was locked.

From,
Barry

I tried on both 001-key.jpg and 003, but the key.txt in three was blank tried what the walkthroughs suggested:
steghide extract -sf 001-key.jpg # did not work , there should not be a password
and 
binwalk -e 003-key.jpg # empty key.txt

https://github.com/strange07/tryhackme/blob/master/biohazard/biohazard.md for the complete key

open the doom.tar.gz:
SSH user: umbrella_guest

-> goto /hidden_closet -> input -> helmet_key

The closet room lead to an underground cave

In the cave, Jill met injured Enrico, the leader of the STARS Bravo team. He mentioned there is a traitor among the STARTS Alpha team.

When he was about to tell the traitor name, suddenly, a gun shot can be heard and Enrico was shot dead.

Jill somehow cannot figure out who did that. Also, Jill found a MO disk 1 and a wolf Medal

Chris: Yes, Jill. Unfortunately, he play us like a damn fiddle.
Jill: Let's get out of here first, I have contact brad for helicopter support.
