# Jeeves Helped-Through

Name: Jeeves
Type: Pwn
Date:  
Difficulty:  Easy
Goals:  
- Begin the learn to Pwn all the things with Retired Box with CryptoCat, Active box for 
Learnt:

While setting up I found how I needed to improve my system so by the time I had done basic file checks  and then started [CryptoCat Writeup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgoCGETbnZg) I did not realise I do the [[Reg-Writeup]] first as that is apparently a simple buffer overflow and ret2win style challenge. So I will start that first try for an hour and if I fail I will turn it to a helped-through cited CryptoCat as i have done here. Also I will attempt one HTB Active Challenge from this Category to make a start getting my teeth into pushing points and really developing this area of Hacking skillset. As Low-Level is the future and probably my weakest area in terms of coverage in my Cheatsheets, Archive, etc...
