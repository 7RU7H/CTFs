|             Uses a "pointer" abstraction, which monitors UI events for both mouse and touch.
|             Tracks when the pointer "drags" on a certain element, meaning down+move+up.
|         
|             Also, tracks if there was touch-scrolling.
|             Also, can prevent touch-scrolling from happening.
|             Also, can fire pointermove events when scrolling happens underneath, even when no real pointer movement.
