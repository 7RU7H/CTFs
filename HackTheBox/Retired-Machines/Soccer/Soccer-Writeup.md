The recon for this box was mostly done on a bad day in 28th March  . Over my lunch I facepalmed very as I thought that I might turn this into a Help-Through to go along with my current finish all the CREST machines while I build momentum. Instead I realised the issue very quickly I had given up on a 301 status code out of having a bad day. So I saw up to the login and thought that is just one self humiliation for the road. This box needs to be complete just due to this.
