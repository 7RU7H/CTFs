| Name | Apache HTTP Server 2.4.20-2.4.43 - HTTP/2 Cache-Digest Denial of Service Attack |
| Authors | philippedelteil |
| Tags | cve, cve2020, apache |
| Severity | high |
| Description | Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43 are susceptible to a denial of service attack. A specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers. |
