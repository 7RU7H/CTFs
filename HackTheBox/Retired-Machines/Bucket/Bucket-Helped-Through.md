# Bucket Helped-Through

Name: Bucket
Date:  
Difficulty:  Medium
Goals:  
- Compare AWS with Azure  
- Have some idea of what AWS other than the words s3 and it uses an api for cloud stuff
- Perform a Linux Hardening and Persistence
- Hunt for 3 more content creators for this type of learning exercise - want to do one a week to compliment start really focusing on completing one HTB Active machine a week from Febuary. 
Learnt:
Beyond Root:
- Harden box
- Add a low and high priv Persistence + plus create a vuln on the box
- Return to every description of AWS vs Azure - Look at what my notes say, then search engine dork and ChatGPT the answers for a average time per AWS  vs Azure point.

I will be helped through by [Alh4zr3d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSug24hrQdo) as part of Newbie Tuesday; this video covers "Bucket" from HacktheBox, in which we tackle some common misconfigurations in Amazon Web Services (AWS)! My caveat and challenge being while doing this box is to both add AWS to the archive as a baseline definition of what it is and how to hack it, but more important perform a recall exercise about Azure while I am going along. So I will be stopping and starting the video alot abit like drink everytime someone says X, its explain how the same thing works in Azure without looking at notes or looking up. I think this is a cool way to kill all the birds with one stone by hacking away with someone parasocially, doing Azure recall to see where I do not know - good luck with `az` and `powershell` commands future me, learning about AWS via Azure knownledge and Hacking AWS for the second timne other than a THM AoC that was not very in depth or I did not take it that seriously over a year ago.
