Quick list of outstanding items / bugs / feature requests for CP:

* Make a (semi) automated way to allow non-superusers to run all actions

* Put complete Nagios templates on a page somewhere

* Get more language translations

* Investigate report of an empty fsm_pages causing 255 out of range error

* Check the current logfile is not bigger than X KB/MB/GB

* Have the checksum action only warn once and save the result somewhere

* Reconsider PGBINDIR and see if there is something more standard

* Support for pg_bouncer checks

* Full and correct support for Nagios, e.g.
  http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html#AEN203

* Test for all the Nagios output of each action.

* For last_analyze and last_vacuum, way to skip null (never been hit)

* Check at least one table has been vacuumed/analyzed since X time

* Put on CPAN

* Check every table has been vacuum|analyze at least once. (no NULL)

* Check at least one table has been vacuumed|analyzed since X hours/days/...

* Check the current logfile is not bigger than X KB/MB/GB

* Make the bloat estimation more accurate (lots of small bad assumptions in there)

* Consider a more accurate bloat check, using the expensive pg_stattuple function

* For the Nagios 'perf' output on last_analyze and last_vacuum (and other things with a time), 
consider making a single global timing call.
