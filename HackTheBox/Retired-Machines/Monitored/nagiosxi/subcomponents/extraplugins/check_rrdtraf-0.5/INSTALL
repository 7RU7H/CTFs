INSTALL
-------
check_rrdtraf requires rrdtool and the standard unix utilities bc, awk, and sed

To install, simply copy the check_rrdtraf file to your Nagios plugins 
directory, and verify that it is executable (chmod a+x check_rrdtraf)

NOTE IF UPGRADING FROM VERSION 0.2:

Some changes will need to be made to how you call the script-
* Files are now specified as full-path rather than just file name. Should make
  things easier if you have rrd files stored in more than one location :)
* File expiration time is now specified in seconds rather than minutes. This is
  due to a different, more efficient, method of determining file age (see 
  changes)
