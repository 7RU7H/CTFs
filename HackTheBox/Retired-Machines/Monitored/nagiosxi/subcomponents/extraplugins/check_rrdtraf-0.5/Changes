November 25, 2008 - Changes in v0.5
* Bug: typo in OS type check causing occasional issues
* Added: Now sets the LC_NUMERIC environment variable to (hopefully) solve issues caused by systems that used different number formats than the script expected.

March 6, 2007-v0.4a:
* Changed: Modified the help output to properly reflect changes in v0.4
* Added: Changes (this file), INSTALL, and README files to the distribution 
  package

March 1, 2007-v0.4:
* Added: Performance data output
* Added: Verbose output using -v and more verbose output using -v -v or -vv
* Changed: Version switch is now -V to better conform with nagios plugin 
  guidelines (and to allow the -v for verbose)

January 29, 2007-v0.3:
* Changed: No more need to edit the script before first run (hopefully)!
* Changed: -f switch now takes full-path to RRD file rather than just the name
* Added: Auto-scaling output units. If the units to use for output are not 
  specified via the -l switch, the display will now automatically scale to the
  most appropriate units.
* Changed: File expiration now uses the stat command rather than find. it 
  SHOULD determine the proper flags to use on your OS automatically, but if 
  you get an error when using the -e switch, please let me know 
  (israel@frontierflying.com), along with the output of the uname command for 
  your OS.
* Changed: -e switch now takes arguments in seconds rather than minutes

January 18, 2007- v0.2:
* Initial release
* Changed: Uses command-line switches (-e, -f, etc) rather than positional 
  arguments
* Added: File expiration check
* Changed: Separated incoming and outgoing traffic levels/alarms
* Changed: different data retrieval/calculation methods to get better results

v0.1:
* check_rrd_bw
