Currently going for a AZ 104 certification before OCRT or OSPE start look temping after OSCP.  Improve my Administration, Powershell and Networking knownledge, Expereience and understanding. With adminstrating Azure Json plays are crucial role in Templating Resources. Although there I have not research or found any indication maybe the Json is exploitable not after post subscription compromise and a packet level, before Azure deploys stuff. Anyway probably not, but Javascript still exists and boxes with it either I breeze through or I get stuck somewhere before exploiation. Deserialization attacks appear alot. Need to do a box with one.  

Although I probably will end up using Azure Bicep as it seems potential less error prone and less dependency management... And there is [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/)Â are Azure Resource Manager templates provided by the Azure community. Unsafe Templating seems like an attack vector..
