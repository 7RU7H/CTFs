# CTFs
This is a repository for Writeups, Blog-like walkthroughs and Notes, beware of the distinction. 
I am very honest. When I have used ANYONE elses writeups, I will always disclose this, give a shout out and follow them on Github, at the very least. Generally the format reflects my level of competancy at any given CTFs at given points in time. I started Tryhackme in June 2021 and I have amassed alot of pre-2022 notes, blog-like, attempts at going in blind at doing the writeup. Beware that some platforms have guidelines to writeup submission, my <CTF><-Writeup>.ext will abide by those guidelines. Everything else WILL NOT - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED - SOME NOTES WILL CONTAIN HASHES and PASSWORDS! 

I will archive them accordly:
<CTF-NAME>-notes.txt    # These are raw note taking, some of which will be pre-notetaking application usage and will not have screenshots
  
<CTF-NAME>-walkt.*      # These will be in more of documentation of my general learning progress in blog style, sometimes raw tex.
- *Pre 2022=.txt        # The formatting we improve over time with screenshots and nicer looking file formats.
                        # I don't plan to retroactively prettify although general editorial work to make them actaully readable.
                        # These will only be from THM boxes were I wanted to learn and while trying to improve my writing in various ways.
  
<CTF-NAME>-Writeup.*    # These distinctly without any aid from anyone else writeups.
