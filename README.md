# CTFs
This is a repository for Writeups, Blog-like Walkthroughs and Notes, beware of the distinction. I am very honest. To make it worse I am dyslexic amongst things, so I did do Linguistics at University, but that may not offset your distaste for my spelling. One day I will be alble to afford grammarly and the time automate  all of it, but for now welcome to the trenchs of idiocy, am also comparatively new and recognise absolutely there are better places to read writeups. I read them. Those people are increbible. Thank you for reading mine and thank those that helped me. When I have used ANYONE elses writeups, I will always disclose this, give a shout out and follow them on Github, at the very least look at what they make and star it. Generally the format reflects my level of competancy at any given CTFs at given points in time. I started Tryhackme in June 2021 and I have amassed alot of pre-2022 notes, blog-like, attempts at going in blind at doing the writeup. My goal is to complete every HackTheBox box possible and see what all the crazy end game stuff is. Just bear in mind that the earlier it is written probably the less cool solutions that I found myself are in writing, but if they were someone else then I will point you to them. Beware that some platforms have guidelines to writeup submission, my `<CTF><Writeup>.md` will abide by those guidelines. 

Everything else WILL NOT - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED - SOME NOTES WILL CONTAIN HASHES and PASSWORDS! 

Pre-2022 are entirely `.txt`, nothing special. The formatting <s>will</s> has improved with screenshots and nicer looking file formats. I still don't plan to retroactively prettify although may general editorial work to make them actually readable. These `.txt` will only be from THM boxes were I wanted to learn and while trying to improve my writing in various ways in an actually realistic timeframe. I will archive them accordly:

## `<CTF-NAME>-Writeup.*`    
These distinctly without any aid from anyone else writeups.
  
## `<CTF-NAME>-Walkthrough.*`      
These will be in more of documentation of my general learning progress in blog style, sometimes raw text.

##   `<CTF-NAME>-Notes.txt`
 These are raw note taking, some of which will be pre-notetaking application usage and will not have screenshots
