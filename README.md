# CTFs

This is a repository for CTF Writeups, Blog-like Walkthroughs, Helped-Throughs and Notes, beware of the distinction.

I am very honest. To make it worse I am dyslexic amongst things, so I did do Linguistics at University, but that may not offset your distaste for my spelling or still lack style. One day I will be able to (feel-like I could) afford grammarly and the time automate all of it, but for now welcome to the trenchs of idiocy, am also comparatively new and recognize there are better places to read writeups. [0xDF](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/) or [Snowscan](https://snowscan.io/) to read them or Ippsec to watch them. Those people are incredible. Thank you for reading mine and please thank those that helped me and will help you much more than I think I ever could.

While the previous paragraph may seem as a disclaimer of "do not read please" and to me that is understandable. Writing takes time and mastery can take a lifetime. This is not here for views or stars, this is a system to systematically ensure my honesty. People that drilled or tasked themselve to master something have to be honest with themselves and others. Some of the contents of this repository is called Helped-Through these are "failed" attempt or when I had a rough day and sitting done following along like a baby monkey and rock are when I have used ANYONE elses writeups, I will always disclose this, give a shout out and follow them on Github, subscribe on Youtube etc. I also alway very least look at what they make or have made and starred it and looked at whatever is concensus their best work, or I try to find it and add it to my Archive repository with full reference to them. Generally the format reflects my level of competancy at any given CTFs at given points in time. I started Tryhackme in June 2021 and I have amassed alot of pre-2022 notes, blog-like, attempts at going in blind at doing the writeup. My goal is to complete every HackTheBox box possible and see what all the crazy end game stuff is. Just bear in mind that the earlier it is written probably the less cool solutions that I found myself are in writing, but if they were someone else then I will point you to them. Beware that some platforms have guidelines to writeup submission, my `<CTF name>-<Writeup>.md` will abide by those guidelines. 

Everything else WILL NOT - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED - SOME NOTES WILL CONTAIN HASHES and PASSWORDS! 

Generally now as of late 2022, there are screenshots, code snippets, links, segmented scans in the directories. Everything is much, much better than a year ago. Although beware pre-2022 are entirely `.txt`, nothing special. The formatting <s>will</s> has improved with screenshots and nicer looking file formats. I still don't plan to retroactively prettify although may general editorial work to make them actually readable. These `.txt` will only be from THM boxes were I wanted to learn and while trying to improve my writing in various ways in an actually realistic timeframe. I will archive them accordly:

## `<CTF-NAME>-Writeup.*`    
These distinctly without any aid from anyone else writeups.
  
## `<CTF-NAME>-Helped-through.*`     
These are any where I failed to meet a time limit for myself or was just stumped or I just want to learn about something or be mentored through a box with a writeup or video - just hadns on keyboard, but with less about challenge and more on practical and getting stuff done. 

- I changed these from walkthroughs because it just seemed more fitting and more honest to what they sometimes are.

##  `<CTF-NAME>-Notes.txt`
 These are raw note taking, some of which will be pre-notetaking application usage and will not have screenshots
